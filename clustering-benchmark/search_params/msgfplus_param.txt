#Parent mass tolerance 
#  Examples: 2.5Da or 30ppm

#Fragmentation Method
#  0 means as written in the spectrum or CID if no info (Default)
#  1 means CID
#  2 means ETD
#  3 means HCD
#  4 means Merge spectra from the same precursor (e.g. CID/ETD pairs, CID/HCD/ETD triplets) 
FragmentationMethodID=3

#Instrument ID
#  0 means Low-res LCQ/LTQ (Default for CID and ETD); use InstrumentID=0 if analyzing a dataset with low-res CID and high-res HCD spectra
#  1 means High-res LTQ (Default for HCD; also appropriate for high res CID); use InstrumentID=1 for Orbitrap, Lumos, and QEHFX instruments
#  2 means TOF
#  3 means Q-Exactive
InstrumentID=3

#Enzyme ID
#  0 means No enzyme used
#  1 means Trypsin (Default); use this along with NTT=0 for a no-enzyme search of a tryptically digested sample
#  2: Chymotrypsin, 3: Lys-C, 4: Lys-N, 5: Glu-C, 6: Arg-C, 7: Asp-N, 8: alphaLP, 9: No Enzyme (for peptidomics)

#Isotope error range
#  Takes into account of the error introduced by choosing non-monoisotopic peak for fragmentation.
#  Useful for accurate precursor ion masses
#  Ignored if the parent mass tolerance is > 0.5Da or 500ppm
#  The combination of -t and -ti determins the precursor mass tolerance.
#  e.g. "-t 20ppm -ti -1,2" tests abs(exp-calc-n*1.00335Da)<20ppm for n=-1, 0, 1, 2.
IsotopeErrorRange=-1,1

#Number of tolerable termini
#  The number of peptide termini that must have been cleaved by the enzyme (default 1)
#  For trypsin, 2 means fully tryptic only, 1 means partially tryptic, and 0 means no-enzyme search
NTT=1

#Target/Decoy search mode
#  0 means don't search decoy database (default)
#  1 means search decoy database to compute FDR (source FASTA file must be forward-only proteins)
