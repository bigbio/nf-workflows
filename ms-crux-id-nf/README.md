Simple Mass Spectrometry Identification Workflow
========================

These are versioned, shareable and replicable proteogenomics workflows
that I have used during my PhD. This repository forms half of my
proteogenomics lab notebook. The other (private) half records exactly
what was run and which datasets were used. I'm not in a position to
share the details of the analysis at the moment, but I think that the
nextflow workflows and Docke images might be of use to other people.
